## 📤 How Resume Screening Works

### The Complete Flow:

```
1. Upload Resume → 2. Extract Text → 3. Generate Embeddings → 
4. Calculate Similarity → 5. Classify (Optional) → 6. Make Decision
```

### Detailed Steps:

#### **Step 1: Upload Resume**
- User uploads PDF/DOCX/TXT file through the UI
- File is uploaded to S3
- Resume record created in PostgreSQL

#### **Step 2: Text Extraction & Preprocessing**
```python
# From: backend/ml/preprocessing/text_cleaner.py
- Extract text from PDF/DOCX
- Clean and normalize text
- Remove noise and special characters
- Extract skills, education, experience
```

#### **Step 3: Generate Embeddings** (AWS Bedrock)
```python
# From: backend/ml/embeddings/bedrock_embedder.py
- Resume text → AWS Bedrock Titan → 1536-dim vector
- Job description → AWS Bedrock Titan → 1536-dim vector
- Vectors stored in Pinecone (optional)
```

#### **Step 4: Calculate Similarity Scores**
```python
# From: backend/ml/similarity/scorer.py
Similarity Components:
1. **Semantic Similarity**: Cosine similarity between embeddings (0-100)
2. **Skills Match**: Required skills / Total required × 100
3. **Experience Match**: Years of experience alignment
4. **Education Match**: Education level comparison

Final Score = Weighted Average:
- Semantic: 40%
- Skills: 35%
- Experience: 15%
- Education: 10%
```

#### **Step 5: Binary Classification** (Optional, when trained)
```python
# From: backend/ml/classifier/inference.py
- Input: Concatenated [resume_embedding, job_embedding]
- Model: PyTorch Neural Network
- Output: Probability (0-1) of being a good fit
```

#### **Step 6: Make Final Decision**
```python
# From: backend/ml/hybrid_engine.py
Decision Logic:
- SHORTLIST: Final score ≥ 75 or Classifier prob ≥ 0.75
- REVIEW: Final score 60-75 or Classifier prob 0.5-0.75
- REJECT: Final score < 60 or Classifier prob < 0.5
```

## 🧠 How Model Training Works

### Training Pipeline

The system uses **TWO** ML approaches:

### 1. **Similarity-Based (No Training Needed) ✅**
- **Status**: Already Working
- **Method**: AWS Bedrock embeddings + cosine similarity
- **Advantage**: Zero training required
- **Use Case**: Immediate deployment

### 2. **Classifier-Based (Requires Training) 🔄**
- **Status**: Needs training data
- **Method**: Supervised learning with labeled examples

---

## 📊 Training the Binary Classifier

### Prerequisites:
1. **Labeled Data**: Resumes with known decisions (SHORTLIST/REJECT)
2. **Minimum**: 1000 examples (500 positive, 500 negative)
3. **Optimal**: 10,000+ examples

### Training Process:

#### **Step 1: Prepare Training Data**

Create a CSV file: `training_data/resumes_labeled.csv`

```csv
resume_text,job_description,label,skills,experience_years
"Software Engineer with 5 years Python...","Looking for Senior Python Developer...",1,"python,django,aws",5
"Junior developer fresh graduate...","Looking for Senior Python Developer...",0,"python",0
```

#### **Step 2: Generate Training Dataset**

```bash
# Run data preparation script
python backend/ml/classifier/prepare_training_data.py \
  --input training_data/resumes_labeled.csv \
  --output training_data/processed_training.pt
```

This script:
- Generates embeddings for all resumes and jobs
- Creates feature vectors
- Splits into train/validation/test sets (70/15/15)
- Saves as PyTorch tensors

#### **Step 3: Train the Model**

```bash
# Local training
python backend/ml/classifier/trainer.py \
  --data training_data/processed_training.pt \
  --epochs 50 \
  --batch-size 32 \
  --learning-rate 0.001 \
  --output models/classifier_v1.pt

# OR use the Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/02_model_training.ipynb
```

Training Configuration:
```python
Model Architecture:
- Input: 3072 dimensions (1536 + 1536 embeddings)
- Hidden Layers: [512, 256, 128]
- Dropout: 0.3
- Output: 1 (binary classification)
- Activation: ReLU → Sigmoid

Optimization:
- Loss: Binary Cross Entropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Learning Rate: 0.001 (with scheduler)
- Early Stopping: Patience 5 epochs
```

#### **Step 4: Evaluate the Model**

```python
Metrics to Track:
- Accuracy: Overall correctness
- Precision: Of predicted SHORTLIST, how many are correct
- Recall: Of actual good candidates, how many we found
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- AUC-ROC: Area under the curve

Target Performance:
- Accuracy: ≥ 85%
- Precision: ≥ 82%
- Recall: ≥ 88%
- F1: ≥ 85%
```

#### **Step 5: Deploy the Model**

```bash
# Upload to S3
aws s3 cp models/classifier_v1.pt \
  s3://resume-screening-models/classifier/v1.0.0/model.pt

# Update database
python scripts/register_model.py \
  --model-path s3://resume-screening-models/classifier/v1.0.0/model.pt \
  --version v1.0.0 \
  --metrics accuracy:0.85,precision:0.82,recall:0.88
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "AWS Bedrock not configured"
**Solution**: The system works without AWS Bedrock, but with reduced functionality
- Similarity scoring will use basic TF-IDF instead
- To enable: Add AWS credentials to `.env`

### Issue: "Pinecone error"
**Solution**: Pinecone is now optional
- Vector search is disabled but system works
- To enable: Get API key from https://pinecone.io

### Issue: "No screening results"
**Solution**: Check that:
1. Job was created successfully
2. Resume file uploaded correctly
3. Check backend logs for errors

---

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Configure AWS** (for full functionality)
2. **Collect training data** (for classifier)
3. **Train the model** (optional, improves accuracy)
4. **Deploy to production** (AWS Lambda + SageMaker)
