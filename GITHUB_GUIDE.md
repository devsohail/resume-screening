# 🚀 GitHub Publishing Guide

This guide will help you safely publish your Resume Screening System to GitHub.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Security First!

Before pushing to GitHub, ensure all sensitive credentials are removed.

---

## Pre-Push Checklist

### 1. Verify .env is NOT Being Committed

The `.env` file contains your actual credentials and **must never** be committed to Git.

```bash
# Check if .env is in .gitignore
grep "^\.env$" .gitignore

# Expected output: .env
```

✅ `.env` is already in `.gitignore` - it will NOT be committed!

### 2. Verify What Will Be Committed

```bash
# See what files will be committed
git status

# See what would be pushed (should NOT include .env)
git ls-files

# Double-check .env is ignored
git check-ignore .env
# Should output: .env (confirming it's ignored)
```

### 3. Check for Other Sensitive Files

```bash
# Search for potential credential files
find . -name "*.pem" -o -name "*.key" -o -name "*credentials*" -o -name "*.env.local"
```

## Step-by-Step: Push to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **+** icon (top right) → **New repository**
3. Repository settings:
   - Name: `resume-screening` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "AI-Powered Resume Screening System using AWS Bedrock and ML"
   - Visibility: 
     - ✅ **Public** (if you want to share)
     - ✅ **Private** (if keeping it private)
   - ❌ **Do NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
4. Click **Create repository**

### Step 2: Initialize Git (if not already done)

```bash
# Check if git is initialized
if [ ! -d .git ]; then
    git init
    echo "✅ Git initialized"
else
    echo "✅ Git already initialized"
fi
```

### Step 3: Stage Files

```bash
# Add all files (except those in .gitignore)
git add .

# Verify .env is NOT staged
git status | grep .env

# If you see ".env" listed, something is wrong!
# It should NOT appear in "Changes to be committed"
```

### Step 4: Create Initial Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI-Powered Resume Screening System

- FastAPI backend with ML screening engine
- React TypeScript frontend
- AWS Bedrock integration for embeddings
- Pinecone vector database
- PyTorch classifier
- Complete documentation and setup guides"
```

### Step 5: Add Remote Repository

Replace `devsohail` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/devsohail/resume-screening.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v
```

### Step 6: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Final Verification on GitHub

After pushing, check your GitHub repository:

### ✅ Files That SHOULD Be There:
- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- LICENSE
- SETUP_GUIDE.md
- SECURITY.md
- .env.example (with dummy values)
- .gitignore
- All source code files
- docker-compose.yml
- requirements.txt

### ❌ Files That SHOULD NOT Be There:
- .env (with real credentials)
- Any files with real AWS keys
- Any files with database passwords
- node_modules/
- __pycache__/
- *.pyc files
- .DS_Store

---

## Update Repository README

Don't forget to update the GitHub repository URL in README.md:

```bash
# Find and replace the placeholder
# Change: https://github.com/devsohail/resume-screening.git
# To: https://github.com/YOUR-ACTUAL-USERNAME/resume-screening.git
```

Or use this command:

```bash
# Replace devsohail with your actual GitHub username
GITHUB_USER="your-actual-username"
sed -i '' "s/devsohail/$GITHUB_USER/g" README.md
sed -i '' "s/devsohail/$GITHUB_USER/g" QUICKSTART.md
sed -i '' "s/devsohail/$GITHUB_USER/g" SETUP_GUIDE.md

# Commit the update
git add README.md QUICKSTART.md SETUP_GUIDE.md
git commit -m "docs: update GitHub username in documentation"
git push
```

---

## Setting Up GitHub Repository Features

### Add Topics/Tags

On your GitHub repository page:
1. Click ⚙️ (settings icon) next to "About"
2. Add topics: `ai`, `machine-learning`, `aws`, `fastapi`, `react`, `resume-screening`, `bedrock`, `pinecone`, `pytorch`

### Add Description

"AI-Powered Resume Screening System using AWS Bedrock, PyTorch, and semantic similarity for intelligent candidate evaluation"

### Enable Issues

Settings → Features → ✅ Issues

### Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

Create `.github/workflows/tests.yml`:

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd backend
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          cd backend
          pytest tests/ -v
```

## Ongoing Maintenance

### Committing Changes

```bash
# Always check what you're committing
git status
git diff

# Stage specific files
git add path/to/file

# Commit with meaningful message
git commit -m "feat: add bulk resume upload feature"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

### Pulling Changes

If working with others or from multiple machines:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```

---

## Security Reminders

### If You Accidentally Committed .env

**Don't panic, but act quickly:**

```bash
# 1. Remove from Git history (if just committed)
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "security: remove .env from repository"
git push

# 2. If already pushed, consider the credentials compromised
# - Rotate all AWS keys immediately
# - Change all passwords
# - Generate new secret keys
# - Update Pinecone API key if exposed

# 3. Clean Git history (advanced)
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository
```

### Regular Security Checks

```bash
# Check for accidentally committed secrets
git log --all --full-history -- .env

# Should return nothing if .env was never committed
```

Reference them in README.md

### Create a Demo Video

Consider recording a quick demo and linking to YouTube/Vimeo

### Share on Social Media

- Dev.to
- Reddit (r/Python, r/MachineLearning)
- Twitter/X
- LinkedIn
- Hacker News (Show HN)

---

## Collaboration

### Accepting Contributions

1. Others can fork your repository
2. They create feature branches
3. They submit Pull Requests
4. You review and merge

### Branch Protection

For production projects, enable branch protection:
1. Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main`
3. Require pull request reviews
4. Require status checks

---

## Making Your Project Stand Out

### Add Badges to README

```markdown
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![Python 3.11+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)
```

### Star the Project

Encourage users to star your repo if they find it useful!

### Keep Documentation Updated

- Update README with new features
- Add examples and use cases
- Keep dependencies up to date

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when pushing

```bash
# Use GitHub CLI (recommended)
gh auth login

# Or use SSH keys
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
```

### "Remote already exists"

```bash
# Remove existing remote
git remote remove origin

# Add correct remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/devsohail/resume-screening.git
```

### Large files being rejected

GitHub has a 100MB file size limit:

```bash
# Remove large files from commit
git rm --cached path/to/large/file

# Add to .gitignore
echo "path/to/large/file" >> .gitignore

# Commit
git commit -m "remove large file"
```
